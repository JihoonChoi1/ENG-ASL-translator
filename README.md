# Inspiration

Over 3.2 million Canadians have hearing impairment which can often create communication barriers and limit opportunities for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. As a result, this creates a stigma related to hearing loss and causes people to deny or hide progressive hearing loss.

## About SoundSpeak

SoundSpeak is a web-based English/ASL translator that allows users to translate English to ASL and ASL to English. Given a typed message, the website will return images of ASL corresponding to each English word. To translate ASL to English, we implemented a front-facing camera screen that allows the user to record themselves signing a message in ASL, which is translated to English (this functionality is in progress).

## How we built it

Initially designed with Figma, implemented with HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of producing an app with functionality and a cohesive colour scheme.

## What we learned

We had to learn how to work with three different languages at the same time and that it's okay to not know things. We learned how to use online resources more effectively.

## What's next for SignSpeak

In the future, we would like to add a database of English words that have existing ASL signs to make our translations more accurate. We would also like to implement a machine learning model that can learn to read ASL signs from a submitted video from the user.
